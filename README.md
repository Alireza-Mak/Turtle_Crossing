# About the Project: Turtle Crossing
In this Python code, I developed a simple game using the Turtle graphics library. As the player, I control a turtle moving through traffic represented by colored cars. The objective is to reach the finish line while avoiding collisions with the cars. The game introduces increasing difficulty levels as I progress, with faster-moving cars and a reduced chance of new cars appearing. A scoreboard displays the current level, and upon collision, a "Game Over" message, along with information about the creator (Alireza Mak) and a website link, is shown. The modular design of the code separates the player, car manager, and scoreboard functionalities, enhancing code organization and readability. This code provides a foundation for an entertaining and potentially customizable game experience.
